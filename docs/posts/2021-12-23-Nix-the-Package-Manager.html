        <p>On my current team we all had different laptops, running different OS <em>(fedora, Ubuntu, MacOS)</em>… We also were juggling between different projects, in different languages, with different dependencies, and different environment variables…</p>
<p>Hence, we often were facing the following struggle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It works on my side</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also remember how hard it was to get a fully working Haskell environment when we started developing our project with this language (thank you 32bits <code>lzlib</code> on our 64 bits MacOS…)!</p>
<p><img src="../images/nixpm-sweating.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>Then, we discover <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a>!</strong></p>
<h1 id="what-is-nix">What is Nix?</h1>
<p>Actually, there are two different things behind this name:</p>
<ul>
<li>A package manager</li>
<li>A simple lazy pure functional language that specializes in building packages</li>
</ul>
<p>As I have a basic knowledge of the language (I am able to copy/paste/adapt, but not more for the moment) <strong>this article will be about the Package Manager</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-package-manager-do">What does the package manager do?</h2>
<p>I will not use the most appropriate terms to describe what exactly does this package manager, but <strong>I will give you my comprehension, using my words</strong>. Anyway, you can have a look on the official website about <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html">How Nix works</a>.</p>
<p>Naively, I want to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nix allows you to isolate the <code>build</code> of the package!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In details, for each package built by Nix, it first computes its <code>derivation</code> <em>(this is usually done by evaluating expressions written in the Nix language)</em>.</p>
<p>This <code>derivation</code> will lead in creating a file containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>mentions of all the files and other packages that will be required during the build</li>
<li>build instructions for actually building the package,</li>
<li>some metainformation about the package,</li>
<li>most important, a store path under which the package will be installed: <code>/nix/store/&lt;hash&gt;-&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</code> (where <code>hash</code> is a hash of all the other data in the derivation).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, since the recent changes on Docker pricing policies, we now use <code>colima</code>. But there was no Nix derivation available, here is how our custom one looks like:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>{ buildGoModule, lib, fetchFromGitHub }:

buildGoModule rec {
  name = &quot;colima&quot;;
  version = &quot;0.2.2&quot;;

  src = fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = &quot;abiosoft&quot;;
    repo = &quot;colima&quot;;
    rev = &quot;v${version}&quot;;
    sha256 = &quot;sha256-vWNkYsT2XF+oMOQ3pb1+/a207js8B+EmVanRQrYE/2A=&quot;;
  };

  vendorSha256 = &quot;075wd4xsx0dxqf733ha1hiy1x2hzkxdn6g8g0vn6q9bbqbrscp0p&quot;;

  meta = with lib; {
    description = &quot;Colima - Container runtimes on macOS (and Linux) with minimal setup.&quot;;
    homepage = &quot;https://github.com/abiosoft/colima&quot;;
    license = licenses.mit;
    platforms = platforms.linux ++ platforms.darwin;
    maintainers = with maintainers; [ gsebil08 ];
  };
}</code></pre>
<p><em>Despite the lack of knowledge on the Nix language, this is pretty easy to understand. The original project is a Go module, available on https://github.com/abiosoft/colima. The most difficult part, is to find the <code>sha256</code>, but almost everything is explained in the official documentation</em></p>
<p>Then, it <em>creates</em> the derivation <em>(by running build instructions specified in it)</em> <strong>inside an isolated environment containing the dependencies and only the dependencies of the package</strong>.</p>
<p>This way, Nix guarantees some really important properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Realising the same derivation will always get <em>(almost)</em> the same output</strong>, since the build commands only have access to the explicitly specified dependencies <em>(the output can differ if the build instruction uses some hardware-dependent information)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The same store path</strong> <em>(<code>/nix/store/&lt;hash&gt;-&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</code>)</em> <strong>will always contain the result of <em>exactly</em> the same commands</strong>, since <code>&lt;hash&gt;</code> depends on all the variables that are explictly specified while to build this package.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that was for the theorical part.</p>
<p><strong>But how does Nix helps us everyday?</strong></p>
<h1 id="some-of-the-benefits">Some of the benefits</h1>
<p>I guess there are some others, like the <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/nix_integration/">Nix integration</a> for <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">The Haskell Tool Stack</a>, but since I only use the <code>nix-shell</code>, I do not have any idea of possible other benefits…</p>
<h2 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h2>
<p>This is the first one coming to my mind! And I guess, the real motivation behind Nix.</p>
<p><strong>Two people building the same package will always get the same output</strong>, at least, if you are careful enough with pinning the versions of inputs in place. And in the case of different inputs, it will be very clear since the store path will change!</p>
<h2 id="binary-caching">Binary caching</h2>
<p>Since the store path is known before building it and we are sure that the same store path will contain the same output, we can <em>replace</em> that store path from some other location (as long as that location has that path and we trust the person building it).</p>
<p>To be clear, it is almost like substituting a function by its result since this function is pure and has no side-effects!</p>
<h2 id="multiple-versions-of-any-package-can-be-installed-simultaneously">Multiple versions of any package can be installed simultaneously</h2>
<p>Every package is installed under its own prefix, so there are no collisions. This can be really handy during development – think Python’s virtualenvs but for any language!</p>
<p>To sum up, you can have two different versions of <code>docker-compose</code> (as long as they are both available…)!</p>
<h2 id="distributed-building">Distributed building</h2>
<p>Since we know exactly what is needed to <em>create</em> any derivation, it can be done remotely as long as the remote server has all the dependencies already (or can build them faster than the local machine).</p>
<h2 id="easy-onboarding">Easy onboarding</h2>
<p>I remember projects with a <code>getting started</code> section requiring to globally install dozens of different packages, with sometimes, a very specific version… Then you spent hours, or even days to get your development environment ready because nothing goes exactly like explained in this <code>getting-started.md</code> file…</p>
<p>Thanks to Nix, you can provide a fully working <code>nix-shell</code>. Hence, the only required tool to install globally on your laptop is Nix. Within this provided <code>nix-shell</code> he will be able to find any referenced packages:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ which docker-compose
docker-compose not found
$ cd my-project-with-nix-shell
$ nix-shell
[nix-shell:~/my-project-with-nix-shell]$ which docker-compose
/nix/store/kchjb4ncrk6c1qakdfd0xk11905fvy7f-docker-compose-1.29.2/bin/docker-compose</code></pre>
<p><strong>How comfortable is that? A lot.</strong></p>
<h1 id="the-ecosystem">The ecosystem</h1>
<h2 id="nixos">NixOS</h2>
<p>Directly linked to the Nix package manager and the Nix language, an OS is available. I do not use it, but if I understand correctly:</p>
<p>NixOS is a GNU/Linux distribution using Nix as both a package manager and a configuration manager. Each configuration file is a derivation, and your whole system is a derivation, which depends on all the applications and config files you have explictly specified. Hence, we get all the benefits of Nix applied to the runtime environment.</p>
<p>To sum up, if two people install a NixOS system that has the exact same store path, they will always get exactly the same system on their computers! Good luck doing that with any other OS!</p>
<h2 id="nixpkgs">Nixpkgs</h2>
<p><code>nixpkgs</code> is a massive collection of package descriptions using the Nix language. Once again, have a look on the <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixpkgs">official wiki</a></p>
<h1 id="you-should-give-it-a-try">You should give it a try</h1>
<p>The <code>nix-shell</code> is definitively a game changer. Even our Product Manager is now able to easily run our applications without our help!</p>
<p>There are different ways to try it out, you can directly try NixOS on your machine, or on a VM. Or, as I do, you can install Nix and provide your own <code>nix-shell</code> for your different projects!</p>
<p>Feel free to have a look on the <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/index.html">Nix pills</a> or even the <a href="https://nix.dev/">Nix cookbook</a>. They both are useful to understand the ecosystem and the glossary of this environment!</p>
